# Analysis of Algorithms
In this project I worked on building an algorithm for Newton's method, which is often considered a greedy algorithm. Newton’s method is a root-finding algorithm which is extensively used in the field of numerical methods. The root-finding algorithm produces better approximations to the roots of a real valued function. 

We were asked to approximate the following values using Newton’s method and they are:
1) √2
2) sin (0.75)

For √2 the results were as follows:

For sin(0.75) the results were as follows:
